# Fate Dice for Owlbear Rodeo

This is a very simple implementation of Fate dice rolling for Owlbear Studio. It keeps a short history of recently rolled dice, as well as who rolled, and it adds the result up for you. It is likely missing most of the features people look for in dice rolling tools for Owlbear Rodeo as I am new to the app and have very little experience using it for campaigns.
